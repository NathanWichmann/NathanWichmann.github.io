# Description
This application is a web-developer portfolio that will be used to show potential employers my cosing abilities. There is a working message section that sends a message directly to my gmail through email.js. The resume section has a pdf viewer that allows the user to print out a copy of the resume. There is an interactive projects section that links directly to each projects respoitory and deployed application on heroku. There are pictures and a description of eack project indicating its use and function. 

# Installation 
This application uses React as the main platform and my different dependencies;
`"dependencies": {
    "@material-ui/core": "^4.12.1",
    "@progress/kendo-drawing": "^1.10.1",
    "@progress/kendo-react-pdf": "^4.7.0",
    "@react-pdf-viewer/core": "^2.4.1",
    "@react-pdf-viewer/default-layout": "^2.6.1",
    "@sanity/client": "^2.11.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.7",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.8.3",
    "emailjs-com": "^3.2.0",
    "pdfjs-dist": "^2.6.347",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.10.1",
    "react-pdf": "^5.3.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "react-social-icons": "^5.5.1",
    "tailwind": "^4.0.0",
    "web-vitals": "^1.1.2"
  },
  and devdependencies;
   "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.2.6",
    "gh-pages": "^3.2.3",
    "postcss": "^8.3.5",
    "tailwindcss": "^2.2.4"
  }`
  This application is published on gh-pages and all sections are functional. The only issue is that I still have to work out is the mobile first respone. Material ui seems to have automatically used a mobile first appraoch, while the tailwind version boasts about being mobile first, the way it is used here that is not the case.

# Usage 
This application will be used as my personal and main portfolio for job searching. 

# What I learnt
I learnt a great deal making this application. There were many issues along the way. There were issues with deploying the application. The process proved to be more difficult than heroku. There were issues with the starting page once deployed, it goes to the my-app version that is not the start page. Tried to remove the my-pp portion in the home-page in the package-json. It seemed to work at first but fpr some reason reverted back. There were issues with rendering the images once deployed to gh-pages. I was forced to import each picture to the projects page, therefore, having to hard code the picture so they would render. There were issues with the mobile first approach. The tailwind website promotes that they are mobile first, however my navbar would say otherwise. I will attempt to fix in in the future as time has become an issue now. Getting close to the end of the program and I must choose my victories. I will fix this before the end of the course hopefully. On a side note the projects page that uses material ui is very responsive.
